Constructing a website from the ground up poses a considerable challenge for a small development team. And let's not even delve into the realm of freelancers, who may often find themselves tasked with crafting backends featuring moderately complex admin panels tailored for content management.

Given the repetitive yet intricate nature of this task, significant effort has been devoted to developing such systems. Robust standards have emerged, adopted even by small companies to streamline web development. Among these, WordPress stands out as the most recognized standard, maintaining a steady growth rate over time. However, today, a plethora of other content management systems have entered the scene, including Shopify, Wix, SquareSpace, Joomla, Drupal, and Webflow. Each of these CMS platforms boasts its own set of advantages and disadvantages, which we'll delve into shortly. But first, to provide a comprehensive overview, let's examine a comparison chart.
![Cms Stats](/assets/images/cms.jpg)
> WordPress dominates the CMS market with a 62.8% share and powers almost half of all websites worldwide, at 43.2%.

This statistic pertains to standard CMS, but there's another class known as headless CMS. Unlike traditional ones, headless CMS lack a monolithic front-end building system and leave it to developers. While this loosely coupled technology serves specific scenarios well, we won't delve into it here.

As evident from the comparison, WordPress stands out as the only CMS offering fully hosted capabilities, which is a notable advantage. While Webflow allows exporting website code, this practice decouples the code from their content management system, essentially defeating the purpose of a CMS. None of the other CMS options in the table provide such capabilities.
